# Python-project

The Boston dataset is a collection of 506 houses in Boston and 14 features of the house.
The aim of this project is to understand the data by perform an exploratory data analysis. I also identify correlations and outliers in the dataset and try to find the best model that fits the data for out-of-sample data as obtained from a 80-20 split. The model built here is a linear regression model.
